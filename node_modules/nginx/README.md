## Hello

This repository stores the files for an NPM package that helps with installing and removing NGINX Virtual Hosts.

## Usage

> **ONLY WORKS ON UBUNTU LINUX AT THIS TIME**

### NPX

Unless you plan on using this package a lot, it would be silly to install it globally for it to just sit there and collect dust like the old family photos in the attic.

Instead, some genius made another package called [NPX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). It allows for a package to be temporarily installed, used, and then deleted. Pretty cool, right?

In order to use it, you have to install NPX like so:

```
npm install -g npx
```

Then from there, you can use my Nginx package by running

```
npx nginx
```

This will bring up an interactive command line interface for you to use the package with.

### The traditional way

If you're going to be using the package a lot, or just don't fancy using NPX, the traditional command to run the package is

```
nginx-install
```

Yes, it'd be nice to have `nginx`, but that causes a load of interferences with the actual Nginx service as it uses the same command. But that's okay, because we can use this command instead.
